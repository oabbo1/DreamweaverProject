<p>Here is a little bit about me.
	<br ><br/>
My name is Olivia Abbott. I am a 21 year old junior Criminal Justice major with a legal studies minor at the University of New Haven in West Haven Connecticut. Though originally I am from Portland Oregon over on the West Coast. While I am at school I like to keep myself busy. I am a member of the Phi Sigma Sigma sorority, I play for the club field hockey team, and I am a member in multiple clubs such as the American Criminal Justice Association. In my off time I love to go downtown to study with my friends, searching for historical landmarks along the east coast, and currently I am on a quest for the best cup of coffee in Connecticut. When I am not at school I go home to Oregon where I spend my summers with my parents, friends, and my dog. While I am home I am always outdoors, I love hiking, biking, swimming, and everything in between. If I am not at home my trusty black lab and I are probably half way up a mountain. Some of my other hobbies include reading, playing piano, eating grilled cheese, and my new favorite which is traveling. This past fall I was able to study in Ireland where I fell in love with Europe. I got the chance to explore multiple different countries including Germany, Scotland, England, and France. Traveling is a new passion of mine which I hope to continue this summer as I will be driving across the country back to Oregon.

Professionally I have had the opportunity to work in a range of different jobs. My first job was as an administrative assistant at a local tutoring center. I have also worked extensively with youth through sports, bike, and environmental science camps. My favorite out of these is called BikeFirst which is a camp I have worked at every summer since I was 14. At this camp my fellow instructors and I teach kids with disabilities to ride bikes. This is a program that is very close to my  heart and the absolute most rewarding job I have ever worked at. In my field I have worked as a data entry researcher and collector for the Center for Analytics, collecting and entering information regarding violence in the middle east. Lastly, this summer I will be working at a local domestic violence shelter in Portland Oregon in the youth advocate department. </p>
